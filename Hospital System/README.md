# Hospital System (Not in OOP)
This project implements a simple hospital system in C++ where patients can be added to different specializations, their
details can be printed, and the next patient can be called for treatment by the doctor. The system supports up to 20
specializations, with each specialization having a maximum capacity of 5 patients.

## Features

- Add new patients to different specializations.
- Print details of all patients in each specialization.
- Get the next patient for treatment in a specific specialization.
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.
